# Casa0006 Final Project
Exploring the Relationship and Impact of Spatial Social Inequality on Childhood Obesity Prevalence in London.

### Introduction
Child obesity has become one of the global public health challenges (World Health Organization, 2018). According to the report released by the Office for Health Improvement & Disparities, from 2023 to 2024, 24% of children in Year 6 were considered obese in London. As Gupta et al. (2012) observe, the diseases caused by childhood obesity might cause psychosocial consequences like discrimination, social stigmatization, and bullying, which experiences not only diminish childrenâ€™s immediate quality of life but also exacerbate existing social inequalities.

While existing studies highlight socioeconomic disparities in childhood obesity spatial interactions in London remain underexplored. This study will examine the relationship between socioeconomic and social environmental factors and childhood obesity, and their spatial clustering across London wards to guide targeted public health interventions.

### The project will address 2 main problems: 

1.	Is the association between childhood obesity and socioeconomic and social environmental factors primarily linear, or do non-linear models capture further nuances?
2.	How do spatial clusters of ward-level childhood obesity and key socioeconomic factors manifest in London, and what do they reveal about regional social inequalities affecting childhood health?
